Repository for [Thoughts on Building Fluent API](https://www.tonys-studio.top/posts/Thoughts-on-Building-Fluent-API/).

This is a demo of building Fluent API in C#. Here we have a simple example a SQL table builder.

In "Basic/", we have a basic implementation of a table builder, but it will allow you to build invalid tables which has no column.

In "Advanced/", we have an advanced implementation of a table builder, which will prevent you from building invalid tables.

The Test project contains tests for both implementations.

Enjoy! :)
